I have a problem with this quest and i've been requested to write it here. There is a problem with this quest. That npc i need killed isnt on the map (i think that he might be under textures, because i see what he says and i get dmg from the lightning but i do not see that npc so i cannot slay it, making this quest unable to complete). i ask You to fix this bug if it is possible.
